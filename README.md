# Algorithms (CS301) Assignments

Be aware that I didn't get full points from all homework. <br>
A1) -5 explanation (effect of randomness) <br>
A2) -5 insufficient/missing explanation modifications <br> 
A3) -20 no SPECIFIC example is given <br>
A4) -5 report (base case is not mentioned in recursive formulation) <br>

Because A5 is a handwritten homework I don't have any record of it, however, I did some complexity analysis by running the algorithm and recording the time it takes, and you can find the code of it in the repository. <br>

Let me also point out that I got an A with 79.8
