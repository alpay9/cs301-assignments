# Algorithms (CS301) Assignments

Be aware that I didn't get full points from all homeworks.
A1) -5 explanation (effect of randomness)
A2) -5 insufficient/missing explanation modifications
A3) -20 no SPECIFIC example is given
A4) -5 report (base case is not mentioned in recursive formulation)

Because A5 is a handwritten homework I don't have any record of it, however, I did some complexity analysis by running the algorithm and recording the time it takes, and you can find the code of it in the repository.

Let me also point out that I got an A with 79.8
